// regExp works to search categories, or other keywords that can be searched
// as text
// location search is dual staged:
// 1. determine type of search term
// list of cities, states and nabes

// source: https://github.com/grammakov/USA-cities-and-states
// 60K+ list of cities, sorted by:
// City|State short name|State full name|County|City Alias Mixed Case
// this can be searched to determine if the search term is a state or major
//  city
//  - if yes, determine city, state, or neighborhood from the 60k list
//   at this stage of Yup's growth, business locations are limited to
//   the NYC metro area
// we need to determine an arbitrary geographical area to limit search results

// Rather than go in this expansive direction, which anticipates a fully fleshed out map of business
//  entities;
// Choose a set amount of neighborhoods, so that you can only search for businesses in those areas.
// this makes more sense with the scale of the project. we can have ten businesses per borough.
// a challenge I want to process is statically created seed data, versus an automated way of gathering
// entities from the internet or other sources of data.
// creating seed data feels like a time suck. I have spent multiple hours generating data by hand, and it seems
// like wasted time and energy.

// one possible solution is to choose ten entities per boro, and limit all search functionality to
// NYC. this is also what Welp creator Amanda Chen (https://github.com/amandac3600/Welp) chose to do,
// and it seems sufficient.
