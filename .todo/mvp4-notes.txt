business CRUD notes

any user can submit a new business for creation, to be verified and potentially added to the yup database.

you can add a business as the owner, or not. verified owners have more control over options.

Businesses from non-owning users are "unclaimed". unclaimed businesses can be claimed by owners, which gives them more access to make changes.

Claimed businesses can be edited. (real yelp businesses would likely have their edits approved and moderated. for Yup, it can be instant access.

The ability to edit on the fly would be impossible to moderate.)
